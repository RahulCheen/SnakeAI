# SnakeAI
In this repo, I have used python to write a simple Snake game using PyQT and have defined a custom environment using Stable Baselines 3 to train PPO and DQN algorithms to play the game

# This repo isn't fully set up yet
I need to reorganize some files and clean up some code before it's ready for development

# If you just want to play the game
You can play the snake game as long as you have the PyQt5 python module. You'll only need the files in the /Game folder. Just run main.py
Use arrow keys to control the snake and the escape key to pause
