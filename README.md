# SnakeAI
In this repo, I have used python to write a simple Snake game using PyQT and have defined a custom environment using Stable Baselines 3 to train PPO and DQN algorithms to play the game

# This repo isn't fully set up yet
I need to reorganize some files and clean up some code before it's ready for development
